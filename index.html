<p class="text-muted text-left"> Luna park is located near the Sydney Harbour Bridge and is theme park were there are many rides and activities to do. These activities and rides include the rollercoaster, merry go round, ferris wheel and more that will bring joy. I have so far gone to Luna Park 3 times and all those times I was living the best life with parades, acitivities that won you prizes, group photos and more. Not only does this pllace have activities put sell food such as crunchy popcorns, fizzy soda and the best of all, the majestic fairy floss.</p>

<h3 class="text-success text-left text-capitilize">Sydney Opera House is a wonderful, maajestic touurist attraction in Sydney.</h3>
<p class="text-muted text-left">Like I talked about before, Sydney Opera house is located near Luna park and is known to be a attractive tourist attraction. Sydney Opera House has been contructed on March 2nd, 1959 and was architechured by Jørn Utzon and Peter Hall. The building was formally opened on 20 October 1973[5] after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation. </p>

<h4>How to make your restaurant sustainable</h4>
<img src="https://www.hospitalitymagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/BioPak-Green-Cold-Paper-Cups-Straws-7.jpg?resize=1536,1152" class="image-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Encourage your customers to always bring reusable containers and cups for their takeaway. In the instances where reusables are not an option, the best alternative for the planet is compostable packaging. 
    2. It’s inevitable that waste will be created in your restaurant or cafe, however, it is important to reduce and divert the organic waste going to landfills as much as possible. To help with this, we’ve made composting easy! With Compost Connect , surplus food can be diverted from waste and be transformed into high-value organic fertiliser – compost. 
    3. Just about every aspect of a food service establishment requires water. The average cafe, depending on size and popularity, can use as much as 20,000 litres of water in a single day. There are multiple ways to reduce your energy and water usage – such as making sure your kitchen is equipped with Energy Star-certified dishwashers, ice makers and steamers), opt for renewable energy instead of fossil fuel and consider getting an energy metre and educating your employees. 
    4. Spread the word and get your customers onboard your sustainable journey too. Let them know you are an eco-friendly business and promote that you’re making a positive difference for the environment by popping it on your website, your social media channels and perhaps blog post. 
    5. A “Profit for Purpose” business is “led by a mission to achieve social, community and environmental benefit through trading and by channelling a portion of their profits toward their mission. This includes for example becoming a carbon neutral certified business, meaning your carbon emission gets reduced to zero or making your business a force for good as a certified B Corp.

<h5>Groups call for Scots ban on plastic cigarette filters over 'horrific' environmental impact</h5>
<img src="https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13833850.jpg?type=responsive-gallery-fullscreen" class="image-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The "horrific" environmental impacts of plastic cigarette filters, one of the most common forms of litter which is hitting Scotland's celebrated water and marine habitats are being spotlighted by health charity ASH Scotland, the Marine Conservation Society, Zero Waste Scotland, Scottish Water and Keep Scotland Beautiful to mark World No Tobacco Day today.They say that almost all of the 3.65 billion cigarettes smoked in Scotland each year are made of the plastic cellulose acetate.

    And the group say the plastic cigarette butts can take more than 10 years to decompose and leach thousands of toxic chemicals; polluting seas and harming marine life.
    
    The environmental and health organisations have called on the Scottish Government to take world-leading legislative action to tackle the negative impacts of plastic cigarette filters and include the items in a single-use plastic ban.
    
    They are also calling on Scots to bin the "offending" items and packaging after use.
    
    In the last year, the Marine Conservation Society’s beach clean and litter surveys have seen volunteers remove more than 1,200 cigarette stubs from 129 beach cleans on Scottish shores.</p>

<h6>Good nutritious food</h6>
<img src="https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/shutterstock_300553067-705x470.jpg" class="image-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Choose a diet made of nutrient-rich foods. Nutrient-rich (or nutrient-dense) foods are low in sugar, sodium, starches, and bad fats. They contain a lot of vitamins and minerals and few calories. Your body needs vitamins and minerals, known as micronutrients. They nourish your body and help keep you healthy. They can reduce your risk for chronic diseases. Getting them through food ensures your body can absorb them properly.

    Try to eat a variety of foods to get different vitamins and minerals. Foods that naturally are nutrient-rich include fruits and vegetables. Lean meats, fish, whole grains, dairy, legumes, nuts, and seeds also are high in nutrients.

<p class="p_modal">In 2009 Malala Yousafzai began writing a blog on BBC Urdu about life in the Swat Valley as the Taliban gained control, at times banning girls from attending school. When her identity was discovered, Malala began to appear in both Pakistani and international media, advocating the freedom to pursue education for all. In October 2011, gunmen boarded Malala's school bus and shot her in the face, a bullet passing through her head and into her shoulder. Remarkably, Malala survived the shooting. At a very young age, Malala Yousafzai has become a worldwide symbol of courage and hope. Her shooting has sparked a wave of solidarity across Pakistan, not to mention globally, for the right to education, freedom from terror and female emancipation.</p>
